#👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Aleks — a Data Automation Specialist with a passion for all things data. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my skills and explore new tools, technologies, and ideas in the data world. Right now, I’m deepening my knowledge of SQL, data architecture, and pandas as part of my ongoing journey to keep learning, growing, and staying curious in this field. This project is one more step along that path.
